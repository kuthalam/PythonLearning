Completed Projects
* Dice Roller project was pretty easy. Will probably practice GUI with it later.
* The "Guess A Number" game was also a quick one, and will benefit a lot from a GUI I think.
* I'm working on the MadLibs one. Strange error on MadLibs: If I try to find number of elements in a tuple with one string (story1), len(tuple) returns the number of characters in story1 instead of just "1"
